# example_DemoECommerceApp
- <scheme name> : <hierarchical part> [? query] [# fragment]
    - hierarchical part also contains the option query and fragment part
- p.14 - caching can be set in the header
- p.16 - verbs chart with safe vs. idempotent vs. nonidempotent
    - `PUT` - either inserts new or updates if exists
    - `OPTION` - gets a list of all allowed operations for a resource
    - `HEAD` - returns only response header with no responst body
- p.17 - `OPTION` response example would look like this `200 OK ALLOW: HEAD, GET, PUT`
- P.18 - `PUT` vs. `POST`
    - `PUT` is indempotent - it can be repeated, and yields the same result every time.  If the resource does not exist, it will create it, otherwise it will update it.    `POST` is nonindemppotent - multiple resources will be created if it is called more than once.  So for `PUT`, the exact URI needs to be specified.  So `PUT http://test.com/authors` will not work.  It will have to be `PUT http://test.com/authors/19` will work.  It will create an author with Id 19 if it doesn't exists and then update else update if author Id 19 exists.  For `POST`, `POST http://test.com/authors` will work and each `POST` call will create a new author Id.  If `POST http://test.com/authors/19` was called, the request won't consider it a new resource, if it doesn't exist.  It will always be treated as an update request,.... so possibly an error if author Id doesn't exist.
- p31 - Create the `DemoECommerceApp` is `File > New > Project > ASP.NET Core Web Application > API`
- p46 - Code for returning HTTP 500 error for faild `POST` is `return StatusCode(500);`
